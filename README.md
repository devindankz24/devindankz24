- 👋 Hi, I’m Devin Herrick
- 👀 I’m interested in football, family, fish keeping and tech in general

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I grew up with a pc, and enjoyed every second of it. My brother is 5 years older so he was teaching me as much as my 6-8 yr old self could retain. Haven't had a computer for the last 20 years, so after finally having the means to build my own pc, the interest and passion for tech I had at 8 yo is ignited again!
